# Mini Overview
Skribbly will be an web app that allows multiple people to enter a room and take turns drawing something from a selection of words. The remaining players try to guess what the word is. Once all players have taken a turn, the points are tallied up. Essentially, it attempts to be a skribble.io remake from scratch
